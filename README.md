# Neuromechanical Simulation in Berkeley Madonna

Neuromechanics seeks to understand how muscles,
motor pattern generators, and the brain interact to produce
coordinated movement. To improve understanding on the
neuromechanics of hand movements, a comprehensive
musculoskeletal model is needed. The development of a
mechanical model of rhythmic hand pronation and supination
may serve as a tool for deeper understanding of the underlying
mechanisms in motor symptoms during rhythmic upper
extremity tasks. Control systems must face inevitable time delays
that can complicate control. This model focuses in on the
variability of muscle delay and can serve as the foundation for
more complex models that characterize disordered motor
movement.
